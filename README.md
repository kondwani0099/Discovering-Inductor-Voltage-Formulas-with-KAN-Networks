## Introduction
Welcome to the Discovering Inductor Voltage Formulas with KAN Networks repository! Here, we explore the practical application of Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) in electrical engineering, specifically in deriving formulas for induced voltage in RL circuits. KANs offer a powerful approach to uncovering complex relationships within data, making them invaluable tools for engineers seeking insights into circuit behavior.

## Overview
In this project, we utilize KANs to discover formulas for induced voltage in RL circuits. By leveraging the capabilities of KANs, we aim to extract meaningful patterns from circuit data and develop accurate models for predicting inductor voltage under various conditions.
